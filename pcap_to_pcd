In order to convert the pcap files into pcd files, You have to use velodyne_pointcloud
package for ros. I downloaded the package using the command
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-velodyne

THen for the file conversion.

RUn the ros   using -> "roscore" in one of the terminals
In the second terminal follow this command:

roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud 32e_points.launch pcap:=(paht of your file)

In the other terminal run this command at the same time to the second terminal command:

rosrun pcl_ros pointcloud_to_pcd input:=/velodyne_points _prefix:=(path to save it)
